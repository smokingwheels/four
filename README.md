A Quick basic program to fire the ignition in your car eg realtime off a old laptop. 
A calibration in needed will have to check my old files.

pcset.bas is a generator and reciever program for the ignition computer, back in the old days I used 3 PC's and counted samples at 48 kHz to balance the input output loops of the program.
